      "The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is a federal corporation established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, as amended. It guarantees payment of basic pension benefits earned by over 33,000,000 of America’s workers and retirees participating in more than 25,000 private- sector defined benefit pension plans. The Single-Employer Program protects about 22,300,000 workers and retirees in about 23,800 pension plans. The Multiemployer Program protects about 11,200,000 workers and retirees in about 1,360 pension plans. By law, the two programs are financially and operationally separate. Operations are financed by insurance premiums set by Congress and paid by sponsors of defined benefit plans, investment income, assets from pension plans trusteed by PBGC, and recoveries from the companies formerly responsible for the plans. For additional information about PBGC, visit www.pbgc.gov. \n",
      "The American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021 — a historic law passed by Congress and signed by President Biden on March 11, 2021 — established the Special Financial Assistance (SFA) Program for certain financially troubled multiemployer pension plans. The SFA payments are derived from appropriated funds and financed by general revenues of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) Office of Management and Administration (OMA): The mission of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s (PBGC) Office of Management and Administration (OMA) is to plan and direct the efficiency and effectiveness of the PBGC’s management and administrative policies and programs, including strategic planning, customer service, budget, procurement, human resources, quality management, and facilities services. The OMA includes five departments: the Budget Department, the Human Resources Department, the Procurement Department, the Quality Management Department, and the Workplace Solutions Department. The Budget Department is responsible for managing and coordinating the formulation and execution of PBGC’s budget, ensuring that the Agency’s budget is executed within the resources provided, managing the allocation and reallocation of resources, including full time equivalent work years (FTE), leading and overseeing the planning and cross departmental coordination that helps support the changes in workload resulting from pension plan terminations, expanded multiemployer plan assistance, increased requests for standard terminations, and corporate efforts to prevent plan terminations or other requirements.\n",

      "Process: PBGC successfully adopted a modified Agile SCRUM approach for major modernization projects. Unlike traditional SCRUM and continuous integration practices, finished work from each sprint is queued up with that of other sprints as part of a Release Train. Once all the sprints in the Release Train have been completed and undergone thorough User Acceptance Testing, the Release Train can then be pushed to PBGC’s Production environment. PBGC recognizes that Agile neither reduces/eliminates robust and proven PMI® Project Management disciplines and practices nor reduces/eliminates sound systems engineering documentation. All system engineering efforts must comply with PBGC’s IT Solutions Life Cycle Management (ITSLCM) framework which provides the overarching framework for implementing IT at PBGC. PBGC’s ITSLCM is included in PBGC Directive IM-05-07 which provides the policies, roles, and responsibilities for IT practitioners. The IT Management Directive is a part of this contract and Task Order and is available on www.pbgc.gov https://www.pbgc.gov/about/procurement. Although the journey to and tools used for sound systems engineering documentation (e.g., Requirements Document, Design Document) may be quite different on an Agile project than a traditional waterfall project, the rigor and philosophy behind them (e.g., traceability, data modeling) remain the same and necessary artifacts must be delivered in compliance with the ITSLCM, and other PBGC guidelines. Given the Agile approach, the Contractor must work with the IT Product Manager and Business Product Owner and key stakeholders to map Agile artifacts with ITSLCM deliverables and utilize PBGC- provided DevOps tools. For example, in Agile, the design document may be incrementally built but ultimately must provide enough detail to demonstrate how user stories/requirements were translated into functionality and supported by the technical implementation. A copy of the ITSLCM Framework and Handbook are provided in Attachment 11 – IT Solutions Life Cycle Management (ITSLCM) Framework and Attachment 10 – ITSLCM Handbook.\n",

A Contractor authorized to use a commercial subcontracting plan shall include in its subcontracting goals and in its SSR all indirect costs, with the exception of those such as the following: Employee salaries and benefits; payments for petty cash; depreciation; interest; income taxes; property taxes; lease payments; bank fees; fines, claims, and dues; original equipment manufacturer relationships during warranty periods (negotiated up front with the product); utilities and other services purchased from a municipality or an entity solely authorized by the municipality to provide those services in a particular geographical region; and philanthropic contributions.

When the goals in a subcontracting plan are amended, these goal changes do not apply retroactively.\n",
      "(j) Subcontracting plans are not required from subcontractors when the prime contract contains the clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Products and Commercial Services, or when the subcontractor provides a commercial product or commercial service subject to the clause at FAR 52.244-6, Subcontracts for Commercial Products and Commercial Services, under a prime contract.\n",
      "(k) The failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to comply in good faith with (1) the clause of this contract entitled \"Utilization Of Small Business Concerns;\" or (2) an approved plan required by this clause, shall be a material breach of the contract and may be considered in any past performance evaluation of the Contractor.\n",
      "(l) The Contractor shall submit ISRs and SSRs using the web-based eSRS at http://www.esrs.gov. Purchases from a corporation, company, or subdivision that is an affiliate of the Contractor or subcontractor are not included in these reports. Subcontract awards by affiliates shall be treated as subcontract awards by the Contractor. Subcontract award data reported by the Contractor and subcontractors shall be limited to awards made to their immediate next-tier subcontractors. Credit cannot be taken for awards made to lower tier subcontractors, unless the Contractor or subcontractor has been designated to receive a small business or small disadvantaged business credit from an ANC or Indian tribe. Only subcontracts involving performance in the United States or its outlying areas should be included in these reports with the exception of subcontracts under a contract awarded by the State Department or any other agency that has statutory or regulatory authority to require subcontracting plans for subcontracts performed outside the United States and its outlying areas.\n",
      "(1) ISR. This report is not required for commercial plans. The report is required for each contract containing an individual subcontracting plan.\n",
      "(i) The report shall be submitted semi-annually during contract performance for the periods ending March 31 and September 30. A report is also required for each contract within 30 days of contract completion. Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period, unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer.

      "      (a) Recompetition of service contracts may in some cases result in lowering the compensation (salaries and fringe benefits) paid or furnished professional employees. This lowering can be detrimental in obtaining the quality of professional services needed for adequate contract performance. It is therefore in the Government’s best interest that professional employees, as defined in 29 CFR 541, be properly and fairly compensated. As part of their proposals, offerors will submit a total compensation plan setting forth salaries and fringe benefits proposed for the professional employees who will work under the contract. The Government will evaluate the plan to assure that it reflects a sound management approach and understanding of the contract requirements. This evaluation will include an assessment of the offeror’s ability to provide uninterrupted high-quality work. The professional compensation proposed will be considered in terms of its impact upon recruiting and retention, its realism, and its consistency with a total plan for compensation. Supporting information will include data, such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys and studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in establishing the total compensation structure.\n",
      "      (b) The compensation levels proposed should reflect a clear understanding of work to be performed and should indicate the capability of the proposed compensation structure to obtain and keep suitably qualified personnel to meet mission objectives. The salary rates or ranges must take into account differences in skills, the complexity of various disciplines, and professional job difficulty. Additionally, proposals envisioning compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors for the same work will be evaluated on the basis of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high-quality work, and availability of required competent professional service employees. Offerors are cautioned that lowered compensation for essentially the same professional work may indicate lack of sound management judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement.\n",
      "      (c) The Government is concerned with the quality and stability of the work force to be employed on this contract. Professional compensation that is unrealistically low or not in reasonable relationship to the various job categories, since it may impair the Contractor’s ability to attract and retain competent professional service employees, may be viewed as evidence of failure to comprehend the complexity of the contract requirements.\n",
